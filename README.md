## ABSTRACT
The Purpose of this Report is to show how Ethereum can be implemented in flight delay insurance. Our Solution allows customers to buy flight delay insurance policies that automatically trigger payouts based on real-time fight data by utilizing a decentralized marketplace on Ethereum. This Paper describes business strategy that prioritizes efficiency, cost-savings, and market transparency along with the technical implementation, which includes machine learning models for delay prediction and dynamic insurance pricing. According to our analysis that this blockchain-based solution offers an alternative to traditional insurance with the potential to lower fraud and enhancing customer satisfaction through automated claim processing.
## Introduction
In today ‘s world, air travel has become an essential part of our lives. Either way, flight delays are a common inconvenience that can cause huge financial losses for the agents. Right now, insurances offer a solution, but they have high administration costs and delaying claims process. Blockchain technology and smart contracts can revolutionize how we handle flight delays in our world. Smart Contracts are self-executing piece of codes places on a decentralized network like blockchain. If a condition is fulfilled the agreement will be executed immediately, without manual processing to be needed. Our idea is based on purchasing flight delay insurance policies through a decentralized marketplace on Ethereum. Smart contracts are monitoring real time flight data trough predictions from the past. If a flight delay occurs and if certain conditions are fulfilled, the smart contract automatically triggers a payout to the insured traveler.
# Market Analysis
## Market Size
The market value of global travel insurance is estimated to be 16.8 billion dollars in 2022 and will reach a growth of 20.1% to 2032. Like travel insurance, the number of tourists will increase, so more people will fly in the future. The insurance market is huge, and it will only increase, so they must implement new technologies to make the process faster. Every airline has their own policies, about how they will handle the delayed or cancelled flights.
## Etherisc & Lemonade
First decentralized insurance app, that insures your flight against delays or cancellations. What makes this app different to normal insurance companies is that you get the payment right after the landing. The customers don’t have to registrate the delay to the insurance company, it will automatically get the information about the issue from their own website “Flight Delay”. 

Lemonade is an insurance company, which focuses on Renters, Homeowners, Cars, Pets and Life insurance. They’re using blockchain for fast claim processing.
## What is the difference?
The difference between flight delay insurance and Etherisc is the creation of a marketplace, where investors or in general people can buy and sell those claims. Through machine learning, predictions about delays and cancellations were made, which will help to get a decentralized version of predictions. On the other hand Lemonade doesn’t include flight delay insurance therefore the comparison between flight delay insurance Lemonade is not really there.  
# Technical Solutions

## Data Processing
The Flight Delay Insurance project employs machine learning to forecast flight delays and adjust insurance premiums in real-time based on the predicted delay duration. The program commences with the loading and cleansing of flight data, the extraction of key time-related features and the separation of datasets for classification and regression tasks.  

In the training phase, the program addresses the issue of class imbalance by computing class weights and training a RandomForestClassifier with these weights. The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including ROC AUC, accuracy, classification reports and confusion matrices. A RandomForestRegressor is trained to estimate the duration of delays for flights that have been delayed, with the resulting estimate evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. 

The WebApp class implements a Flask web application that provides a predictive service for the pricing of flight delay insurance. The application employs pre-trained machine learning models to forecast flight delays and to calculate insurance premiums on a dynamic basis, with the insurance premium being calculated according to the predicted delay duration. 

The predict method defines a Flask route (/predict) that handles POST requests. It processes the request's JSON data, transforming it into a Pandas DataFrame. Subsequently, the classifier model predicts the probability of a delay, and if this probability exceeds a threshold (0.05), the regressor model predicts the delay duration. The insurance cost is then determined based on these predictions, and the results are returned as a JSON response. 
# BUSINESS MODEL
## Case/Problem
As already mentioned, the problems in this case are flight delays and cancellations who are causing significant inconvenience. The processing time of claims are a huge problem and every so often the claims filer wouldn’t get any payment due to different reasons and for those claims are causing high administrative costs for travel delay insurances.
## Customers
Main target Agents are travelers and Airlines or Travel Agencies. Mostly frequent travelers will more likely experience a delay or cancellation during their flight than people who travel less. Travel agencies could use the blockchain technology to implement in their system to enhance their products. 
## Product/Solution Idea
Traditional flight insurance is based on manual processing so creating a decentralized insurance platform with Ethereum will be solution with a market to sell the claims.
# SWOT ANALYSIS
Strengths:
- Efficiency: Claims will be processed automatically
- Cost saving: In traditional Flight delay insurance there are high administrative costs involved and with the following innovation the costs could be reduced.
- Innovation
- Transparency

Weaknesses:
  - Regulatory problems: Rules and Regulations are different in every country so the implementation in every country will be a challenge.
 
Opportinities:
- Fraud detection: Fake claims are hard to verify manually, using blockchain will make it easier to verify the claims truth.
- Market Expansion

Threats/Challenges:
- New technology: The biggest challenge will be to implement the landscape of insurance across different countries and their regulations. Convincing and educating people about technology and their positives. Most people have the fear of the unknown and fear of failure.

# Legal Analysis
Our company must comply with several legal considerations. Firstly, smart contracts can potentially automate insurance claims for flight delays based on predefined conditions. It is crucial to ascertain whether these contracts are intended to serve merely as execution tools or legally binding agreements to guarantee their enforceability. For this project, implementing these contracts as smart legal contracts will ensure that they are legally binding, as they fulfill the basic requirements of offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent. Secondly, we must decide whether to register as an insurance company at the state or federal level, taking into account regulatory compliance and the nature of our business. Insurance companies in the United States are typically subject to state-level regulation, as outlined in the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945. Registering in states like Wyoming, which is known for its favorable business environment and blockchain-friendly legislation, offers the added benefit of lower administrative costs and regulatory burdens. Wyoming's innovative legal framework, specifically the Wyoming Utility Token Act, provides a clear legal status for utility tokens and a supportive environment for blockchain businesses. Third, the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly Section V, has significant implications for financial services, including insurance. This section places a strong emphasis on consumer protection, risk management, and transparency. Our practices are designed to ensure that we do not engage in any unfair or deceptive acts. Compliance with these regulations is consistent with the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) Section 5, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices in commerce. Fourth, we are required to comply with state-specific privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which imposes strict data protection measures. It is of the utmost importance to ensure data security and protect customer privacy to avoid legal liability. In addition, consumer protection laws under Section 5 of the FTC Act require that our advertising, promotional materials, and overall business practices be transparent and not misleading. This encompasses adherence to guidelines set forth by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Fifth, our token classification must comply with the relevant regulations. Our tokens are designed with the primary purpose of facilitating the purchase of insurance coverage, rather than as investment vehicles. This classification defines them as utility tokens. This categorization helps to avoid classification as securities, thereby reducing the regulatory burdens associated with such a classification. It is therefore essential to ensure that comprehensive documentation and structuring are in place to guarantee compliance with the Howey test, which determines whether an asset qualifies as an investment contract. Finally, it is essential to have an effective dispute-resolution mechanism to address potential issues. Options include pre-litigation settlements, online dispute resolution (ODR) mechanisms, traditional court systems, or arbitration. On-chain dispute resolution platforms, such as Kleros or JUR.io, offer decentralized alternatives that can resolve disputes efficiently without conventional legal systems. Given our business nature, on-chain dispute resolution mechanisms are suitable due to their transparency and efficiency. Platforms like Kleros use blockchain technology for transparent and efficient resolution processes, where parties submit evidence and receive decisions from a decentralized jury, offering a novel approach to dispute resolution.
