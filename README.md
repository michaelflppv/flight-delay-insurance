## ABSTRACT
The Purpose of this Report is to show how Ethereum can be implemented in flight delay insurance. Our Solution allows customers to buy flight delay insurance policies that automatically trigger payouts based on real-time fight data by utilizing a decentralized marketplace on Ethereum. This Paper describes business strategy that prioritizes efficiency, cost-savings, and market transparency along with the technical implementation, which includes machine learning models for delay prediction and dynamic insurance pricing. According to our analysis that this blockchain-based solution offers an alternative to traditional insurance with the potential to lower fraud and enhancing customer satisfaction through automated claim processing.
## Introduction
In today ‘s world, air travel has become an essential part of our lives. Either way, flight delays are a common inconvenience that can cause huge financial losses for the agents. Right now, insurances offer a solution, but they have high administration costs and delaying claims process. Blockchain technology and smart contracts can revolutionize how we handle flight delays in our world. Smart Contracts are self-executing piece of codes places on a decentralized network like blockchain. If a condition is fulfilled the agreement will be executed immediately, without manual processing to be needed. Our idea is based on purchasing flight delay insurance policies through a decentralized marketplace on Ethereum. Smart contracts are monitoring real time flight data trough predictions from the past. If a flight delay occurs and if certain conditions are fulfilled, the smart contract automatically triggers a payout to the insured traveler.
# Market Analysis
## Market Size
The market value of global travel insurance is estimated to be 16.8 billion dollars in 2022 and will reach a growth of 20.1% to 2032. Like travel insurance, the number of tourists will increase, so more people will fly in the future. The insurance market is huge, and it will only increase, so they must implement new technologies to make the process faster. Every airline has their own policies, about how they will handle the delayed or cancelled flights.
## Etherisc & Lemonade
First decentralized insurance app, that insures your flight against delays or cancellations. What makes this app different to normal insurance companies is that you get the payment right after the landing. The customers don’t have to registrate the delay to the insurance company, it will automatically get the information about the issue from their own website “Flight Delay”. 
Lemonade is an insurance company, which focuses on Renters, Homeowners, Cars, Pets and Life insurance. They’re using blockchain for fast claim processing.
## What is the difference?
The difference between flight delay insurance and Etherisc is the creation of a marketplace, where investors or in general people can buy and sell those claims. Through machine learning, predictions about delays and cancellations were made, which will help to get a decentralized version of predictions. On the other hand Lemonade doesn’t include flight delay insurance therefore the comparison between flight delay insurance Lemonade is not really there.

## Data Processing
The Flight Delay Insurance project employs machine learning to forecast flight delays and adjust insurance premiums in real-time based on the predicted delay duration. The program commences with the loading and cleansing of flight data, the extraction of key time-related features and the separation of datasets for classification and regression tasks.  

In the training phase, the program addresses the issue of class imbalance by computing class weights and training a RandomForestClassifier with these weights. The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including ROC AUC, accuracy, classification reports and confusion matrices. A RandomForestRegressor is trained to estimate the duration of delays for flights that have been delayed, with the resulting estimate evaluated using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric. 

The WebApp class implements a Flask web application that provides a predictive service for the pricing of flight delay insurance. The application employs pre-trained machine learning models to forecast flight delays and to calculate insurance premiums on a dynamic basis, with the insurance premium being calculated according to the predicted delay duration. 

The predict method defines a Flask route (/predict) that handles POST requests. It processes the request's JSON data, transforming it into a Pandas DataFrame. Subsequently, the classifier model predicts the probability of a delay, and if this probability exceeds a threshold (0.05), the regressor model predicts the delay duration. The insurance cost is then determined based on these predictions, and the results are returned as a JSON response.
